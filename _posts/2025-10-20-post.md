# Cyber Log — October 20, 2025
**Focus Areas:** Privileged Access Management, Ephemeral Credentials  

---

## Objectives
Explore methods to secure administrative accounts and implement time-bound privilege escalation models.

---

## Activities & Labs
- Studied four PAM concepts: password vaulting, time-limited authorization, just-in-time permissions, and ephemeral credentials.  
- Documented workflow for temporary elevation and revocation.  
- Compared manual privilege revocation vs automated lifecycle controls.  
- Designed draft SOP for privileged-access request handling.  

---

## Knowledge & Concept Highlights
- Privilege reduction minimizes attack surface.  
- Ephemeral credentials lower risk of credential reuse.  
- PAM integrates technical and procedural enforcement layers.

---

## Reflections & Takeaways
Privileged-access design requires both policy and automation.  
Temporary access principles will inform Red-Team privilege-escalation defenses.
