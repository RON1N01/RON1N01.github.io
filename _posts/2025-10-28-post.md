# Cyber Log — October 28, 2025
**Focus Areas:** Security Architecture review, SCADA, Continuity Integration  

---

## Objectives
Consolidate Security+ Section 3 material and finalize architecture comprehension through scenario-based exercises.

---

## Activities & Labs
- Compiled nine-question quiz set for section3finalreview including RTO, RPO, MTBF, MTTR, SCADA, warm site, and signed firmware.  
- Practiced differentiating between hardware, software, and service redundancy.  
- Studied how industrial control systems integrate into enterprise network architecture.  
- Reinforced operational resilience frameworks.  

---

## Knowledge & Concept Highlights
- SCADA controls physical processes; requires segmentation and security monitoring.  
- Warm sites balance cost with readiness.  
- Signed and encrypted firmware ensures device authenticity and tamper resistance.

---

## Reflections & Takeaways
Section 3 objectives fully integrated; focus shifted from recall to reasoning.  
System architecture security now feels intuitive and practical.
