### 🧠 Objective
Continue production environment setup by resolving endpoint enrollment and credential prompts, enabling remote management, and preparing Windows devices for compliance and licensing alignment.

### ⚙️ Activities

#### 1. Intune Enrollment Issue
- User attempted to install a printer driver on a newly enrolled device; system requested elevated credentials.  
- Root cause: **User account lacked administrative privileges post-enrollment** (default MDM security baseline).  
- **Resolution Path:**  
  - Remote in via Teams and elevate installation using admin credentials.  
  - Confirm installation and enforce least-privilege principle after completion.  

#### 2. Remote Management (Atera)
- Determined Atera agent not pre-installed.  
- Plan: deploy Atera remotely once Intune license assignment confirmed.  
- Verified Atera `.msi` can be pushed via Intune or installed manually during first-boot provisioning.

### 🧩 Findings
- **Intune security baselines** enforce local admin removal by default—must plan for temporary elevation when deploying drivers or agents.  
- Atera deployment should occur *post-enrollment* to ensure device reporting under correct tenant ID.  
- Windows 11 Pro baseline mandatory for Intune policy support.

### 🔐 Best Practices
- Automate Atera deployment via Intune once pilot stable.  
- Standardize hardware setup checklist (Edition → Join → Agent → Compliance → Validation).
