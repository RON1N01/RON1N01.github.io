## Overview
Focus areas included **risk management strategies**, **SOC 2 frameworks**, **quantitative risk calculations (SLE, ARO, ALE)**, and long-term mastery planning. The day’s study mixed Security+ domains 1 and 5 with reflective career and personal mastery work.

## 1. Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies

**Scenario discussed:**  
> Colleen’s organization deployed WAFs to block SQL injection attacks.  
> Which risk strategy is this?

### Key Takeaway
- **Avoidance vs Mitigation:**  
  - *Avoidance* → eliminate exposure completely (e.g., decommission service).  
  - *Mitigation* → reduce likelihood/impact (e.g., deploy WAF).  
  - The chosen control (WAF) = **Mitigation**, though some answer keys label it “Avoidance.”  
  - Decision hinges on whether the threat was *prevented* (avoidance) or *contained* (mitigation).

## 2. Quantitative Risk Assessment Formulas

| Metric | Definition | Formula | Example |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **SLE** (Single Loss Expectancy) | Expected loss from one event | `SLE = AV × EF` | $50 000 × 0.25 = $12 500 |
| **ARO** (Annual Rate of Occurrence) | Frequency per year | Given or estimated | 0.5 (once every 2 years) |
| **ALE** (Annual Loss Expectancy) | Yearly impact | `ALE = SLE × ARO` | $12 500 × 0.5 = $6 250 |

 **Quantitative Risk Assessment** = numeric estimation (SLE, ARO, ALE).  
Qualitative = probability × impact matrix.

## 3. SOC 2 Type 1 vs Type 2 Frameworks

| Report Type | Focus | Time Coverage | Notes |
|--------------|--------|---------------|-------|
| **SOC 2 Type 1** | Design of controls | Snapshot (point in time) | Verifies existence, not effectiveness |
| **SOC 2 Type 2** | Design + Operating Effectiveness | Continuous (≥ 6 months) | Evaluates if controls *actually work* |

 SOC 2 Type 2 includes ongoing **risk assessment**, **vulnerability scanning**, and **testing** activities—but **not necessarily full penetration tests** unless explicitly scoped.

##  4. Agile & CI/CD Review

**Agile:** Iterative development emphasizing adaptability and feedback.  
**CI/CD:** Continuous Integration (merge and test code frequently) → Continuous Deployment (automatic release to production).  
Together they shorten the feedback loop and improve secure coding pipelines.

## 5. Incident Response Policies (IR Policy)

- Defines **who**, **how**, and **when** incidents are detected, reported, and resolved.  
- Includes communication plan, roles, escalation path, and documentation requirements.  
- Essential for compliance under SOC 2 Type 2 and ISO 27001.

## 6. Personal Reflection — Mastery and Discipline
A philosophical close to the study day: examining whether it’s sustainable to study **16 hours a day for a year** and how *Robert Greene’s “Mastery”* reframes lifetime learning.  
Conclusion → Balance intensity with longevity: structured, evolving routine through decades, not burnout in months.

## Summary
- Clarified nuanced difference between **risk mitigation and avoidance**.  
- Reinforced formulas for **SLE, ARO, ALE**.  
- Differentiated **SOC 2 Type 1 vs Type 2** expectations.  
- Strengthened mental model of **Agile/CI/CD security integration**.  
- Reconnected professional grind with long-term **mastery ethic**.
