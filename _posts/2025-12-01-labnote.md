## Summary

Hands-on Linux CLI practice through the TryHackMe “Shells Bells” room. Focused on navigation, log analysis, encryption/decryption, and file discovery in a pseudo post-exploitation scenario. Turned the work into a structured writeup and PDF. Available after event is over. 

## Lab: TryHackMe — Linux CLI: Shells Bells

## Reflections

- My shell skills are leveling up fast.
- These exercises bridge Security+ theory and real red-team practice.
