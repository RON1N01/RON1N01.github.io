# Overview
A full day focused on hashing algorithms, file integrity checks, and understanding how verification systems work in real environments. Strengthened command-line skills and built deeper intuition around hash properties and checksum validation.

# Cybersecurity Topics Covered
- Identifying hash modes for SHA1, Cisco ASA MD5, and generic hashes.
- Determining hash length and structure to infer algorithm type.
- Understanding how file verification works using checksum files.
- Learning what `md5sum -c` actually verifies internally.
- Understanding how attackers and defenders use checksums to confirm integrity.
- Practiced base64 encoding using CLI.

# Key Commands Practiced
```
# Generate MD5 hash
md5sum passport.jpg

# Verify hash against checksum file
md5sum -c checksum.txt

# Base64 encoding
echo -n "message" | base64
```

# Important Notes
- Verification (`-c`) compares computed hash to the stored hash in a checksum file.
- Learned example checksum filenames: `hashes.md5`, `checksums.txt`, `files.sha1`, `verify.md5`, `integrity.sum`.
- Clear separation between hashing for storage, hashing for verification, and hashing for attack enumeration.
