# [2025-08-30 :: Lab Note — Hydra Focus & Error Log Building]

---

### Security+ Review
- Continued practice questions, added all missed ones to personal **error log** for review.  
- Reinforced process of memorizing **impact analysis steps** in change management.  

### Lab Work
- Dedicated session on **Hydra command syntax**.  
- Broke down key flags (`-f`, `-V`, `-W`) and their purpose.  
- Experimented with different output methods, including `tee` for saving results.  

### Reflections
- Realized value of **structured error tracking** — mistakes become material for mastery.  
- Hydra requires not just brute force, but smart handling of results and persistence files.
