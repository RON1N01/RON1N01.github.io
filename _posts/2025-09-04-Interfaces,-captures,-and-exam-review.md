## Title: Interfaces, Captures, and Exam Review

---

### Security+ Review
- Continued working through **SY0-701 exam simulation results**.  
- Logged missed questions into error log for later quizzing.  
- Key concepts reinforced today:  
  - **RTO vs RPO vs BIA** (disaster recovery + continuity).  
  - **Change management elements**: impact analysis, backout plan, SOPs, maintenance windows.  
  - **Rogue access point** and **evil twin** distinctions.   
  - **Agent-based vs server-based scanning**.  

### Lab Work
- Explored **network interfaces** in Linux (e.g., `eth0`, `ens33`, `wlp2s0`, `wlo1`).  
- Clarified difference between **onboard adapters** vs **PCI slot devices**.  
- Practiced with **tcpdump** on wireless interfaces to capture traffic.  
- Worked on **TryHackMe Brute It privilege escalation path**:  
  - Used `unshadow` to merge passwd + shadow files.  
  - Ran John the Ripper with status monitoring.  

### System Setup
- Customized **Kali Linux**:  
  - Adjusted resolution for retina display.  
  - Increased font/icon size.  
  - Themed the terminal for long-session usability.
