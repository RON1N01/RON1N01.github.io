## Summary

I focused on clarifying my learning pipeline, exposure to the offensive scene, and how I will structure my daily grind so the technical work actually compounds.

## Cybersecurity Activities

### 1. Path and Curriculum Review

- Reviewed the overall training path:
  - CyberSec 101 fundamentals
  - TryHackMe and CTF practice leading toward PT1
  - Long term progression toward eJPTv2 and deeper red team work
- Broke the path into concrete stages:
  - Foundations: Linux, networking, basic scripting
  - Web basics: HTTP, status codes, cookies, sessions
  - Offensive core: enumeration, exploitation labs, post exploitation

### 2. CTF and Community Orientation

- Noted the role of CTFs for:
  - Practicing real exploits in a safe environment
  - Learning to chain multiple vulnerabilities

### 3. Study Capacity Planning for Cybersecurity

- Designed a study routine that prioritizes security work:
  - Targeted 4 hours of focused cybersecurity study on workdays.
  - Added extended blocks on weekends that are fully dedicated to labs and writeups.
- The goal is to maintain a weekly total that supports real technical growth rather than random bursts.

## Key Takeaways

- The red team path is long, but now there is a clear structure: foundations, labs, CTF exposure, and certifications.
- CTFs and structured labs will be my main training grounds for offensive skills.
