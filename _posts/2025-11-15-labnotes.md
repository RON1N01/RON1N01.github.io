# Overview
Focused heavily on cryptography fundamentals, especially Diffie-Hellman and RSA. Multiple problem-solving sessions to understand modular arithmetic, exponentiation, and the creation of public keys. Also addressed personal focus issues and tied them into disciplined study habits.

# Cybersecurity Topics Covered
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange math walkthrough.
- Computing public keys: A = g^a mod p.
- Understanding where results like 19 come from during modulo operations.
- RSA fundamentals: p, q, n, phi(n), modular inverse, e × d ≡ 1 mod φ(n).
- Learning how to correctly choose *e* that is coprime with φ(n).
- Understood modular notation and gcd meaning.
- BIOS access troubleshooting for HP laptops (sysadmin knowledge).

# Commands / Concepts Practiced
```
# Modular exponentiation concept:
A = g^a mod p

# gcd (greatest common divisor)
gcd(e, phi) = 1

# RSA modular inverse
e × d ≡ 1 mod φ(n)
```

# Notes
- Began understanding exponentiation using modulo step-by-step.
- Identified mental fatigue patterns and reinforced discipline.
- Connected cryptographic math with real-world pentesting foundation.
