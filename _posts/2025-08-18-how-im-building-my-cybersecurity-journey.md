Title: How I’m Building My Cybersecurity Journey

I’m documenting my path in cybersecurity to keep myself accountable and to share what I learn along the way. I’m early in the journey, but I’m serious about building real, practical skills and turning them into results.

What I’m focused on right now

Security+: I’m ~50% through the course and tightening fundamentals: risk, identity, network security, and incident response.

CCNA next: I studied networking deeply before; this time I’m committing to the exam to formalize what I know.

Skills I’m building

Git & GitHub for version control and publishing.

Jekyll + GitHub Pages to run this blog and share notes.

Bash scripting to automate small tasks and sharpen command-line fluency.

Hands-on practice (labs/CTFs) to connect theory to reality.

What you can expect here

Short, practical write-ups: notes, fixes, scripts, pitfalls.

Study summaries for Security+, then CCNA.

Red ↔ Blue takeaways: how an attack works and how to detect/mitigate it.

Occasional project logs and tooling tips.

Why public

Sharing forces clarity. It also creates a trail I can look back on to measure the work, not the mood. If you’re on a similar path, I hope this helps—and I’m open to feedback.
