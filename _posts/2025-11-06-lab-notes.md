# RON1N01 Lab Notes

## Security+ Review — Final Prep Phase
Dedicated to tightening the final bolts before exam day.  
I focused heavily on **Section 3 (Security Architecture)** and **Section 4 (Operations)** questions, reviewing missed items and dissecting why each answer was right or wrong.  

### Key Concepts Reviewed
- **Network Appliance Identification:**  
  Confirmed that a device concealing internal IPs, filtering ads, and applying content control corresponds to a **proxy server**, not a firewall or UTM.  

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules:**  
  Reaffirmed that preventing basic SQL injection attacks is best handled by **filtering out single quotes (`'`)**, not by blocking all SQL statements or AND/OR operators.  

- **Impact Analysis Steps:**  
  Reviewed the correct order: request for change → initial assessment → impact & risk analysis → mitigation planning → approval → implementation → monitoring.  

- **Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA):**  
  Defines the technical and security requirements for securely connecting two organizations’ systems to ensure protected and monitored data transmission.

- **802.1X & EAP:**  
  802.1X enforces **port-based network access control**, while **EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)** provides the framework for authentication within that process.
