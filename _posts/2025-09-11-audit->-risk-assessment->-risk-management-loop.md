# Audit → Risk Assessment → Risk Management Loop

## Cycle Overview
This cycle represents how audits, risk assessments, and risk management feed into one another.  
It is not a straight line but a continuous loop.

## Stage Definitions

### Audit
- Validates the effectiveness of **current controls**.
- Relies on evidence provided by process owners.
- Considered a **current-state risk assessment tool**.
- May include recommendations for improvement, but not mandatory.

### Risk Assessment
- **Identify and analyze** risks.
- Focuses on threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact.
- Produces a prioritized risk register.
- Purely diagnostic: does not decide on responses.

### Risk Management
- **Decide and act** on risks.
- Determines responses: Mitigate, Transfer, Avoid, Accept.
- Implements new or updated controls.
- Strategic and action-oriented.

## Summary Flow
1. **Audit** checks effectiveness of existing controls.  
2. Findings feed into **Risk Assessment** for deeper analysis.  
3. **Risk Management** decides how to respond and implements changes.  
4. New or modified controls are subject to the next **Audit**, closing the loop.
