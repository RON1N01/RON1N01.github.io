## Summary
Today’s work focused on diagnosing Windows licensing behavior, troubleshooting Windows Hello/MFA re-registration, and reinforcing Security+ study material (SOC 2 and risk strategies).

---

## Observations and Findings
### Windows Licensing (slmgr / ShowKeyPlus)
- `slmgr.vbs /dli` output: **OEM_DM CHANNEL**  
- `slmgr.vbs /dlv` output: no expiration or activation data shown  
- Mixed ShowKeyPlus results (some OEM:DM, others Retail/Pro). Indicates both OEM-bound and Retail keys across machines.

### Windows Hello / MFA / PIN
- Steps: removed MFA methods → required re-register → revoked sessions → rebooted.  
- Still prompted for PIN; “Remove this sign-in option” greyed out.  
- Likely enforced by Intune/Entra Hello for Business policy.

### Security+ Study Topics
- **SOC 2 Type 1:** evaluates design of controls at a point in time.  
- **SOC 2 Type 2:** evaluates control effectiveness over time.  

---

## Commands and Outputs
```bash
slmgr.vbs /dli   # → OEM_DM CHANNEL
slmgr.vbs /dlv   # → no expiration / activation section
```

---

## Analysis
- **Licensing:** OEM_DM licenses are hardware-bound; Retail keys can transfer under Microsoft terms.  
- **Hello for Business:** Greyed-out removal = enforced policy. Review Intune or GPO configuration.
