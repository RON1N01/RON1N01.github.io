### Security+ Review
- Continued review questions, pace steady to focus on comprehension.  
- Reinforced differences between **MAC vs DAC** access controls.  

### Lab Work
- Hydra troubleshooting on VM (connection was unstable).  
- Tested reducing parallel threads to improve reliability.  
- Compared VM vs AttackBox performance for brute-force attempts.  

### Reflections
- Recognized that troubleshooting the VM is part of the skillset.  
- AttackBox proved more stable, letting me focus on the actual Hydra workflow.
