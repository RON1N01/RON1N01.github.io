# Lab Notes — September 21, 2025

## Sysadmin Work
- No major sysadmin updates logged this day.

## Security+ Studies
- Compared **Authy vs Google Authenticator vs Microsoft Authenticator**.  
- Reviewed Apple’s security code system.  
- Learned what a **YubiKey** is and how it strengthens MFA.  
- Continued reinforcement of access control and risk concepts.  

## Security Research
- Explored **grassroots hackers** definition and relevance.  
- Looked into **AI security research paths**, including ensemble learning and random forests.  
- Researched **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** (chapters, book structure, potential use for AI security focus).  
- Logged interest in **Meetup group** studying ML with this book (noted chapter 7 status).  

## Notes
- Reflected on personal study routine (8–5 work, 5–9 study, weekends for meetups/congregation).  
- Balanced focus between **Security+ path (Sec+, CCNA, Red Team certs)** and curiosity-driven AI/ML exploration.
