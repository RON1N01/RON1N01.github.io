## Overview
Security+ prep day emphasizing **infrastructure hardening**, **career path mapping**, and **threat modeling fundamentals**. Conversations covered salary benchmarking for sysadmin and pentester roles, long-term certification trajectory, and foundational technical concepts like **RTOS vulnerabilities** and **AES encryption standards**.

---

## 1. Security+ Domain 1 — Architecture and Design
### Topic: Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
- RTOS devices are often **vulnerable due to limited patching** and inability to install endpoint protection.  
- They’re **less frequently targeted** not because they’re secure, but because they’re **isolated or specialized**, e.g., embedded controllers and industrial firmware.  
- Security focus: **segmentation**, **network isolation**, and **firmware validation**.

---

## 2. Cryptography Review
- Revisited **AES-512** reference — clarified that **AES officially supports 128, 192, 256-bit keys**.  
- “AES-512” is a **non-standard term** sometimes used informally to describe extended custom implementations.  
- Reinforced importance of using **FIPS-approved algorithms** for compliance.

## 3. Sysadmin Practice — Git and File Management
**Goal:** streamline Markdown posting workflow to GitHub Pages.  
Key commands reviewed:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated daily lab notes"
git push origin main
```
Added optional suffix automation:
```bash
rename 's/([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})\.md/$1-post.md/' *.md
```
Ensures consistent file-naming convention for published logs.

## 4. Security+ Domain 5 — Governance, Risk, and Compliance
- Reaffirmed difference between **PaaS**, **SaaS**, and **IaaS** services in context of Outlook .com and Microsoft 365.  
- Outlook .com = **SaaS**, since Microsoft manages both the app and infrastructure.  
- Reviewed **data responsibility boundaries** between vendor and user.

---

## 5. Certification Roadmap and Role Progression
- Current trajectory: **SysAdmin → Pentester (Red Team with Purple tint)**.  
- Short-term goal: **Security+** completion.  
- Mid-term: **CCNA**, **CySA+**, and **Pentest+**.  
- Long-term: Red Team specialization with cloud and AI-security crossover.

---

## Key Takeaways
- RTOS vulnerabilities stem from **limited patchability**, not invulnerability.  
- **AES-512** ≠ valid AES variant — stick to AES-256 for compliance.  
- Maintain version control consistency with automated renaming.  
- Understand **shared-responsibility models** in cloud contexts.  
- Keep certification path tied to evolving sysadmin-to-red-team roadmap.
