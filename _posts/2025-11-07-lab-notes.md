## Achievement
I passed the **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** exam.

Months of late nights, study sessions, section reviews, and endless quizzes finally paid off. This wasn’t luck — it was discipline, focus, and persistence forged day after day. I earned this.

## Reflection
Every mistake I made along the way became a stepping stone. Every wrong answer forced me to understand, not just memorize.  
I didn’t just study cybersecurity — I *became* the kind of person who finishes what he starts.

> “The warrior does not fear the thousand enemies ahead; he fears the thousand distractions within.”

Today, I beat those distractions.

## Celebration
Chipotle in hand, peace in mind.  
No studying tonight — just satisfaction, silence, and that quiet fire that says, *“I did it.”*  
The burrito tastes better when you’ve earned it.

*The disciplined become dangerous.*
