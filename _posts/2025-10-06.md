### ⚙️ Technical Focus
- Continued sysadmin workflow and troubleshooting:
  - Disk management for NVMe via Windows Disk Management and Ubuntu installation (LVM setup, encryption options, etc.).
  - Confirmed the *120 GB NVMe* suitability for adversarial AI project (DAAI).
  - Completed a fresh Ubuntu install and validated desktop access for DAAI sandbox.
  - Noted that “file /casper/vmlinuz not found” indicates a corrupted ISO or mis-flashed USB (use Rufus with DD mode if it repeats).

- **Projects involved:**
  - `DAAI` – Dedicated Adversarial AI environment setup.
  - `securityresearch1` – baseline prep for USB driver analysis.
