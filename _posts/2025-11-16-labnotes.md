# Overview
Mixed day of cryptography, sysadmin tasks, and workflow adjustments. Continued practicing Diffie-Hellman, RSA, and modular arithmetic. Troubleshot macOS Dock behavior, learned command-line editing workflows, and prepared lab notes for posting.

# Cybersecurity Topics Covered
- More Diffie-Hellman key exchange practice.
- Clarified creation of Alice’s public key A = g^a mod p.
- Practiced modular math for both DH and RSA.
- Understood exponent formatting in Markdown for blog posts.
- Practiced hashing and encoding knowledge.
- Reviewed factoring and prime identification (RSA foundations).

# Sysadmin Topics Covered
- Attempted to hide Finder and Trash icons from macOS Dock (not natively possible).
- Time zone conversions (CST↔PST for meetings).
- Git workflow for lab note publishing.

# Commands & Steps Practiced
```
# macOS Vim operations
yy      # yank line
dd      # delete line
p       # paste line
```

# Notes
- Strengthened understanding of modulo meaning through repeated child-level breakdowns.
- Practiced Markdown math formatting for exponents in cybersecurity content.
- Resolved confusion around division symbol on macOS keyboard.
