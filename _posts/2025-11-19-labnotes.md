# Overview
A key day studying Responder errors, TCP server binding conflicts, and what services Responder attempts to emulate. Clarified terminology used in professional cyber comms environments and continued senior pentester planning.

# Cybersecurity Topics Covered
- Responder's role in LLMNR/NBT-NS/MDNS poisoning.
- Why Responder throws TCP server errors when ports are already in use.
- Which ports matter for SMB credential harvesting (SMB 445/139).
- Determining whether Responder is still listening even when HTTP/LDAP/RDP bindings fail.
- Learned YARA basics: pattern-matching rules for malware classification and detection.

# Troubleshooting Steps Practiced
```
# Identify conflicting services
sudo ss -tulpn | egrep ':80|:53|:389|:3389'

# Stop services binding to important ports
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl stop xrdp
sudo systemctl stop slapd
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved

# Start Responder manually
sudo responder -I ens5
```

# Professional Terminology Learned
- "YARA" = malware pattern-matching rule framework.

# Notes
- Even with port binding errors, Responder remains functional for SMB poisoning.
- This aligns with THM workflows in CVE-2024-21413 labs.
