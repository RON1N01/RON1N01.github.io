## Overview
A full-spectrum Security+ review day emphasizing **network architecture**, **protocol security**, **disaster-recovery terminology**, and **exam-scoring optimization**. I practiced identifying subtle distinctions between overlapping Sec+ terms and validated understanding with numeric reasoning exercises.

## . Network Architecture & Secure Design

### Jump Server (Jump Box)
**Scenario:**  
> Brandon deploys a server in a VLAN used for IoT devices. Admins SSH to that server to manage systems in the protected network.  

**Answer:** **Jump Server**  
- Acts as a **controlled intermediary** between secure and restricted network zones.  
- Provides **segmentation** and limits direct access to sensitive devices.  
- **UTM (Unified Threat Management)** is *not* correct here—UTMs filter traffic, they don’t broker administrative sessions.

---

### Port Mirroring & TAPs
- **Port Mirroring (SPAN)** is a **switch feature**, not a standalone device.  
  - Duplicates packets from selected ports to a monitoring port (e.g., for NIDS/NIPS).  
- **Network TAPs** are **hardware** interceptors installed inline, forwarding traffic to analyzers.  
  - Used when switch mirroring is unavailable or limited in throughput.

---

### VLAN vs Network Segment
- VLAN = logical segmentation within a single switch fabric.  
- Network Segment = broader concept (could include VLANs or separate physical networks).  
**Security principle:** each segment/VLAN defines a distinct **broadcast and trust boundary**.

## 2. IPSec and IKE Tunnel Sequence

### Components in Order
1. **IKE (Internet Key Exchange)** – negotiates security parameters and authenticates peers.  
2. **SA (Security Association)** – defines encryption/authentication algorithms.  
3. **Mode Selection:** Transport Mode (encrypts payload only) or Tunnel Mode (encrypts entire packet).  
4. **IPSec Processing** – uses ESP/AH with negotiated keys to protect traffic.  

**Tunnel Mode → gateway-to-gateway** (common for VPNs)  
**Transport Mode → end-to-end** (e.g., host-to-host comm).

---

### Key Roles
| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| **IKE** | Establishes key material & SA negotiation |
| **SA** | Contains crypto parameters |
| **IPSec** | Encrypts & authenticates packets |
| **ESP** | Provides confidentiality & integrity |
| **AH** | Integrity only (no encryption) |

---

## 5. Additional Concepts Reviewed
- **Checksum vs Hash:** checksum = error detection; hash = integrity + auth binding.  
- **Obfuscation:** hides logic without encryption; distinct from confidentiality.  
- **Geofencing:** security apps enforcing location-based access.  
- **Full vs Snapshot Backups:** snapshots capture memory + storage; full = disk data only.

## 6. Reflection
The session balanced **technical recall** and **self-analysis**—bridging conceptual knowledge (IPSec flows, VLAN segmentation) with measurable performance metrics. You identified **Section 5 (GRC)** as the next area of attack and reinforced real-world sysadmin parallels like VLAN boundary enforcement and VPN tunnel negotiation.
