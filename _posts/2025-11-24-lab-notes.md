## PatriotCTF – First Challenge Completed
I participated in [PatriotCTF](https://pctf.competitivecyber.club/) to sharpen my offensive fundamentals and get more comfortable in competitive environments.

I managed to complete **one challenge on my own**.  
It required cracking a password that ended with two digits, and I solved it using **John the Ripper** with the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

## Lessons Learned
- I didn’t document the exact commands I used, which means I can’t produce a full writeup.  
- Going forward, I’ll track every step, every attempt, and every tool.  
- Small reps like this build toward larger goals, especially **PT1** and then **eJPTv2**.

## Notes for Next Time
Next CTF, I want to walk away with at least one complete writeup and a clean command log. This was a good starting point, and the next round will be tighter and better documented.
