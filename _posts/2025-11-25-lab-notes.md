## Technical Work

### VMware Hanging Process Fix
- VMware GUI would not open even though background process was active.
- Verified with:
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep vmware
  ```
- Solution that restored UI:
  ```bash
  killall -9 "vmware-vmx"
  ```

### TryHackMe OVPN Route Issue
- tun0 received **192.x.x.x** instead of expected **10.65.x.x**.
- Able to ping **8.8.8.8**, but lab hosts were unreachable.
- Likely routing rules not pushed to interface.
- Useful review commands:
  ```bash
  ip route
  ip a | grep tun0
  sudo openvpn file.ovpn
  ```
- Task forward: enforce route or reimport config.

## Workflow Optimization
- Streamlined hardware carry‑kit to avoid lab inertia.
- Final pack:
  - Laptop
  - Keyboard
  - Charger

Goal: less setup friction means more attacking time.
