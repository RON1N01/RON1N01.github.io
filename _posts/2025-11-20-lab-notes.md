## Overview
Focused study and hands-on practice across Linux service management, PostgreSQL behavior, Nmap scanning techniques, Vim search-and-replace, shell one-liners, echo flags, sudo flags, ports, and lab workflow. Continued refining command mastery and strengthening fundamentals required for eJPTv2 and red team progression.

## Linux & Systemctl
- Reviewed how systemctl controls system services.
- Clarified that systemctl manages all services the system knows about.
- Example:
  ```
  systemctl status postgresql
  systemctl start postgresql
  ```

## PostgreSQL Notes
- PostgreSQL does not start by default on many Linux distributions.
- Requires user account and password.
- Name derived from POST InGRES + Query Language.

## Sudo -u Flag
- sudo -u <user> runs a command as another user.
- Example:
  ```
  sudo -u postgres psql
  ```

## Nmap Technique Review
### -sV
Service and version detection.

### -p-
Scans all 65535 ports.

### Combining Scans
Cannot merge SYN + UDP + A into one shorthand.

Example:
```
nmap -sS -sU -sV -p- <target>
```

## Port Behavior
- 49178: ephemeral
- 4444: common Meterpreter listener

## Vim Search and Replace
```
:%s/19/20/g
```

## Shell: Multiple Lines with Echo
```
echo -e "1.1.1.1\n2.2.2.2\n3.3.3.3\n4.4.4.4\n5.5.5.5" > target.txt
```

## Commands Practiced
```
systemctl status postgresql
systemctl start postgresql
sudo -u postgres psql
nmap -sV -sS -p- <target>
vim :%s/19/20/g
echo -e "line1\nline2" > file
```

## Reflection
Clear improvement in fundamentals for eJPT path.
