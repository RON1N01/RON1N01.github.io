# Cyber Log — October 7, 2025
**Focus Areas:** Defense-in-Depth, Asset Management, Intune Baselines  

---

## Objectives
Strengthen understanding of enterprise defense layers and reinforce device-management baselines through Intune practice.

---

## Activities & Labs
- Reviewed NIST SP 800-53 control families for awareness of administrative, technical, and physical safeguards.  
- Applied configuration policies to test endpoints in Intune sandbox.  
- Practiced conditional-access creation based on device compliance.

---

## Knowledge & Concept Highlights
- Administrative vs technical vs physical controls.  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) design in cloud environments.  
- Security baselines and drift detection.

---

## Reflections & Takeaways
Began translating abstract control frameworks into concrete Microsoft cloud implementations.  
Confidence growing in mapping theory to practice.
