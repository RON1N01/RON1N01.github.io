# [2025-08-31 :: Lab Note â€” Hydra Grind & Thread Tuning]

---

### Security+ Review
- Continued through practice set, focusing on **access control models** (DAC vs MAC).  
- Took time to re-explain concepts in my own words to reinforce memory.  

### Lab Work
- Hydra brute force attempts on VM.  
- Adjusted parallel threads (down to 1) to troubleshoot errors and stability.  
- Began comparing **wordlist strategies** (small top lists vs large lists like `rockyou.txt`).  

### Reflections
- Recognized value in *incremental wordlists* (top100, top1000, etc.) for efficiency.  
- Learned that cracking is as much about **strategy and tuning** as raw compute power.
