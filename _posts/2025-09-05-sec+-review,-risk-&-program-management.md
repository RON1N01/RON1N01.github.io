### Security+ Exam Prep
- Worked through practice exam question scenarios on asset management and IT service processes.
- Clarified that **configuration management** (not change or release management) is the process used to track and manage IT assets and their dependencies.
- Logged missed question in the error log for future review.

### Risk & Program Management
- Reviewed **configuration management** as an ITIL framework process for Security+.
- Reinforced distinction between configuration, change, and release management to avoid confusion in exam scenarios.
