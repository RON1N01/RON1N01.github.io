# Cyber Log — October 18, 2025
**Focus Areas:** Network Monitoring, SIEM Concepts, Incident Detection  

---

## Objectives
Develop understanding of network-monitoring techniques and incident-detection workflows within enterprise environments.

---

## Activities & Labs
- Studied SIEM architecture and log-collection methods.  
- Reviewed correlation rules and alert-tuning processes.  
- Compared switch-based port mirroring vs network taps for visibility.  

---

## Knowledge & Concept Highlights
- Network taps operate as passive inline devices; port mirroring is switch software-based.  
- SIEM centralizes log correlation and enables detection of patterns across data sources.  
- Importance of log normalization for accurate analytics.

---

## Reflections & Takeaways
Understood how monitoring points affect visibility and detection quality.  
Logging without context produces noise; correlation provides meaning.
