# Overview
Focused on deep Windows 11 provisioning troubleshooting during OOBE. Practiced bypassing Microsoft account requirements, diagnosing broken onboarding flows, and understanding errors tied to Windows login provisioning. Also researched hardware for cybersecurity workflows.

# Cybersecurity & Sysadmin Topics Covered
- Using `oobe\bypassnro` to bypass Microsoft account binding during setup.
- Identifying errors related to network-dependent OOBE binaries.
- Understanding why MS accounts may fail during provisioning.
- Investigated laptop performance specs for OBS, Zoom, screen sharing, and PDF editing.
- Covered time zone conversions (CST to PST) relevant for coordinating training calls and pentest windows.

# Commands & Steps
```
Shift + F10   # open CMD during OOBE
oobe\bypassnro
```

# Notes
- The error `oobenetworkconnectionflow.exe not found` indicates a missing or misinitialized OOBE component.
- For cyber workflows, CPU single-core performance is more important than GPU for Zoom/OBS-lite use cases.
- Documented recommended hardware paths for budget-friendly cyber laptops.
