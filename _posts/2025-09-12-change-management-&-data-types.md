# Lab Notes – September 12, 2025

## Key Topics Studied
- **Change Management Concepts**
  - Approval Process → prevents unauthorized changes by requiring review/authorization.
  - Impact Analysis → request, initial assessment, analysis, risk assessment, mitigation, approval, implementation, monitoring.
  - Backout Plan → steps to restore systems if a change fails.
  - Maintenance Window → scheduled downtime for patches/config changes.
  - SOPs → formal step-by-step procedures for repeatable security tasks.

- **Data Types (Security+ exam focus)**
  - **Regulated Data** → governed by laws (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).
  - **Trade Secrets** → internal business data giving competitive advantage.
  - **Intellectual Property** → creations of the mind protected by law.
  - **Financial Information** → transactions, liabilities, assets.
  - **Legal Information** → contracts, cases, attorney-client communications.
  - **Human-readable vs. Non-human readable** → plaintext vs. binary/encrypted.

- **Threats & Vulnerabilities**
  - **IoT / Embedded Systems** → medical devices, printers, wearables, home automation all carry security risks.
  - **Supply Chain Attacks** → mitigate with certified vendors, multiple vendors, tamper checks, integrating supply chain into risk management.

## Reflections
- Security+ keeps reinforcing the **risk lifecycle**: identify, assess, mitigate, monitor.  
- Clear lesson today: **structure matters**. Without SOPs, backout plans, and maintenance windows, even good intentions in change management can introduce chaos.  
- IoT threats stood out — even a simple printer can be a pivot point for attackers.
