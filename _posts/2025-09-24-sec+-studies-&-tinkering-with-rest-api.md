# Lab Notes – September 24, 2025  

## Morning Rounds – Security+ Sparring  
- Continued reviewing Security+ practice exam (84/90 questions reviewed).  

## Authorization Models – Untangling the Web  
- Deep dive into **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** vs **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**.  
  - MAC: Labels, strict, system-enforced.  
  - ABAC: Attributes (user, resource, environment), flexible, policy-driven.  

## OSEE vs PCI DSS – Compliance Angle  
- Explored **OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)**. Clarified that “security” in its name doesn’t mean it’s the same as compliance frameworks.  
- Compared **PCI DSS**: contractual compliance, not legislative — sneaky nuance.  

## Local REST API in Obsidian – SSL Trust Issues  
- Task: configure Obsidian’s **Local REST API** to be recognized as a trusted certificate authority in the browser (Mac M1 Pro).  
- Walkthrough of cert installation steps → ensuring browser trust.  
- Noted error: “Authorization required” → fixed by proper API key handling.  

## Afternoon Drift – Exploring Agent Mode  
- Asked: *What is Agent Mode?*  
- Clarified use of ChatGPT’s agent mode on iPhone — potential to act like a lightweight autonomous operator.  
- Cyber context: Could be tied to checking **US-CERT bulletins** automatically → “Agent, check today’s bulletin.”  

## Evening Reflections – Crazy Edgework  
- Wrestled with the idea of **understanding “crazy” perspectives** as a way to unlock creative edge in cybersecurity thinking.  

## Key Wins Today  
- Finished 90/90 Sec+ practice exam question results review
