# Cyber Log — October 8, 2025
**Focus Areas:** Network Segmentation, Conditional Access, Security Architectures  

---

## Objectives
Bridge Security+ network segmentation theory with Intune / Entra Conditional Access labs.

---

## Activities & Labs
- Implemented conditional-access policy limiting sign-ins by compliant devices only.  
- Tested network isolation through VLAN configuration simulation.  
- Studied Zero Trust Architecture principles from CompTIA objectives 3.3.

---

## Knowledge & Concept Highlights
- Logical vs physical segmentation.  
- Zero Trust model — verify explicitly, least privilege, assume breach.  
- Conditional access enforcement points and identity as the new perimeter.

---

## Reflections & Takeaways
Validated understanding of how cloud identity and network segmentation overlap.  
Documentation practices improved by maintaining daily markdown entries.
