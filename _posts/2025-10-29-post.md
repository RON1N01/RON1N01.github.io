# Cyber Log — October 29, 2025
**Focus Areas:** VPN Architecture, IPSec, IKE, Jump Servers  

---

## Objectives
Strengthen understanding of secure network connectivity through VPN and jump server analysis.

---

## Activities & Labs
- Studied IPSec sequence: IKE negotiation → Security Associations → Tunnel establishment.  
- Distinguished between tunnel mode and transport mode.  
- Reviewed jump server purpose in network segmentation and administrative access control.  
- Compared Unified Threat Management (UTM) devices vs dedicated jump hosts.  

---

## Knowledge & Concept Highlights
- IKE establishes key exchange and parameters for IPSec.  
- Security Associations define cryptographic context for the session.  
- Jump servers isolate privileged access and reduce lateral movement risk.

---

## Reflections & Takeaways
VPN and remote administration concepts consolidated.  
Clear grasp achieved of how identity, encryption, and segmentation combine to create layered defense.
