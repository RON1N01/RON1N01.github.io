# Lab Notes – 2025-09-26  

## Highlights
- **Mini-Project: InTune/Entra ID Laptop Configuration**  
  - Configured Windows Hello PIN and multi-factor authentication sequence.  
  - Reviewed Microsoft 365 suite deployment during provisioning.  
  - Assessed necessity of “background service for Microsoft Search in Bing” (concluded as optional/bloatware).  
  - Validated group policy assignment within Intune.  
  - Confirmed capability to install Atera agent remotely and reset Windows Hello PIN remotely.  

- **Command & Error Handling**  
  - Verified how to list active NICs on macOS.  
  - Reviewed error redirection (`2>` = redirect errors).  
  - Clarified technical concepts: Alpine (lightweight Linux distribution), SQLite3 (embedded database engine), and HTTP 304 (Not Modified – caching response).  

- **Docker & Open WebUI**  
  - Reset Open WebUI authentication state.  
  - Removed and recreated Docker volumes to reinitialize first-run setup.  
  - Disabled authentication for localhost development.  

- **Security+ Exam Connections**  
  - Mapped administrative tasks to **change management principles**: SOPs, backout plans, and impact analysis.  
  - Reinforced understanding of provisioning and deprovisioning workflows within secure environments.  

## Reflections
The day’s work underscored the importance of distinguishing between **cloud-synchronized configurations** and **local customizations** in enterprise environments. This principle directly parallels cybersecurity best practices: persistence and continuity should never be assumed—only **policy-driven configurations** ensure consistency across systems.
