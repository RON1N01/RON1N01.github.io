## Overview
Today was a tooling and workflow day. I worked inside Kali on VMware, tuned my terminal setup, and wrestled with tmux, Vim, and VPN behavior.

## Activities

### Kali + tmux + sessions
- who -a, finger, ps -t ttys001 for session tracking
- pkill -t ttys001 to terminate stale terminals
- tmux copy mode: ctrl+b [ , copy select enter, paste ctrl+b ]
- Disabled mouse mode in ~/.tmux.conf:
```
set -g mouse off
```
- Reload tmux config:
```
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

### Vim macros
Stopped accidental recordings via `q`.

### Meterpreter hashdump
Noted redirect vs spool behavior.

### TryHackMe VPN
tun0 mismatch — need to investigate routing and DNS later.

## Commands
```
who -a
pkill -t ttys001
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
ip a | grep tun0
```

## Reflection
Today built operational muscle instead of shells. Small mastery compounds.
