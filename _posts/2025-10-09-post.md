# Cyber Log — October 9, 2025
**Focus Areas:** Security Baselines, Zero Trust, Network Architecture**

---

## Objectives
Consolidate Zero Trust and network architecture studies; ensure comprehension of baseline hardening.

---

## Activities & Labs
- Mapped network diagram illustrating DMZ, internal, management, and IoT segments.  
- Evaluated policy application through Intune security baselines.  
- Compared NIST Zero Trust pillars against CompTIA guidelines.

---

## Knowledge & Concept Highlights
- Role of DMZ in public-facing architecture.  
- Micro-segmentation benefits vs complexity.  
- Integration of conditional access with SIEM alerting concepts.

---

## Tools & Commands
- Draw.io for network diagramming.  
- Intune Security Baseline templates.  

---

## Reflections & Takeaways
Understanding of logical segmentation solidified.  
Recognized need to link monitoring (Blue Team) perspective with Red Team planning for future Purple-tint work.
