I work across **offensive and defensive security**, focused on building
**real-world capabilities**, not theoretical exercises. My background
connects **IT operations, system administration, identity security, and
security tooling** into a practical understanding of how environments
actually break and how they're actually defended.

My work centers on: - Offensive security tradecraft and controlled
exploitation - Detection engineering and investigation workflows -
Identity security with an emphasis on Entra ID and authentication
abuse - Security automation and analyst-focused tooling

I operate with a **Red Team mindset informed by Blue Team reality**.
Offense shows me where systems fail. Defense shows me what actually
catches it. The overlap is where the leverage is.

This site is a working record of tools, experiments, and investigations.
Everything here is built from hands-on practice. No vanity writeups. No
theory without validation.
